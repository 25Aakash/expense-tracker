  - Phone: 16:9 ratio minimum 320px
  - Tablet: Optional but recommended
- Promo Image: 180x120px (optional)
- Hi-res Icon: 512x512px
```

### ❌ **4. Legal Documents (CRITICAL - MISSING)**
**Status: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION**

**Missing Required Documents:**
- ❌ Privacy Policy URL
- ❌ Terms of Service
- ❌ Data Safety Information
- ❌ Contact email/support page

**Action Required:**
Create these essential documents:

1. **Privacy Policy** (MANDATORY)
   - Data collection practices
   - Third-party services used
   - User rights (GDPR, CCPA compliant)
   - Contact information
   - Host on a public URL (not in app)

2. **Terms of Service**
   - User agreements
   - Liability disclaimers
   - Account termination policies

3. **Data Safety Section** (Google Play requirement)
   - What data is collected
   - How it's used
   - Whether it's shared
   - Security practices

### ⚠️ **5. Permissions & Features (NEEDS REVIEW)**
**Status: PARTIALLY CONFIGURED**

**Declared Permissions:**
- [x] CAMERA (for receipt scanning)
- [x] READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
- [x] WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Camera permission declared but no camera implementation found in code
- ⚠️ Storage permissions may not be needed (check if actually used)
- ⚠️ Missing permission descriptions in manifest

**Recommendations:**
- Remove unused permissions to pass review faster
- Add clear permission rationale dialogs in-app
- Update iOS Info.plist descriptions if keeping camera

### ⚠️ **6. Security (NEEDS IMPROVEMENT)**
**Status: BASIC - Not Production Ready**

**Current Issues:**
- ⚠️ JWT tokens stored in AsyncStorage (not secure)
- ⚠️ No certificate pinning
- ⚠️ No biometric authentication option
- ⚠️ No app lock/PIN feature
- ⚠️ Passwords visible by default in forms

**Recommendations:**
```javascript
// Install secure storage
npm install expo-secure-store

// Update AuthContext to use SecureStore instead of AsyncStorage
import * as SecureStore from 'expo-secure-store';

// Replace AsyncStorage calls:
await SecureStore.setItemAsync('token', authToken);
await SecureStore.getItemAsync('token');
```

**Additional Security:**
- Add biometric unlock option
- Implement app lock after inactivity
- Add encryption for sensitive data

### ⚠️ **7. Code Quality (NEEDS CLEANUP)**
**Status: DEVELOPMENT READY - Needs Production Polish**

**Issues Found:**
- ⚠️ 100+ console.log statements in production code
- ⚠️ Debug logs exposed in AuthContext
- ⚠️ API_BASE_URL logged on startup
- ⚠️ No error tracking service integrated
- ⚠️ AnalyticsService is just stubs

**Action Required:**
1. Remove/disable all console.log statements
2. Integrate proper error tracking (Sentry, Bugsnag)
3. Add real analytics (Firebase, Mixpanel)
4. Enable ProGuard/code obfuscation

### ⚠️ **8. Offline Support (MISSING)**
**Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Current State:**
- ❌ No offline data caching
- ❌ No queue for failed API requests
- ❌ No sync mechanism
- ❌ Poor network error handling

**Recommendation:**
- Implement AsyncStorage caching for transactions
- Add offline queue for create/update operations
- Show meaningful offline indicators

### ⚠️ **9. Performance (NEEDS TESTING)**
**Status: UNKNOWN - Requires Profiling**

**Not Verified:**
- Load time on low-end devices
- Large dataset performance
- Memory leaks
- Image optimization
- Bundle size

**Action Required:**
- Test on Android 8.0+ devices
- Profile with React DevTools
- Optimize bundle size
- Test with 1000+ transactions

### ✅ **10. Error Handling (GOOD)**
**Status: IMPLEMENTED**

- [x] ErrorBoundary component present
- [x] Catches React errors
- [x] User-friendly error messages
- [x] Restart option available

**Minor Improvements:**
- Add error reporting integration
- Log errors to backend

### ⚠️ **11. API Configuration (NEEDS FINALIZATION)**
**Status: CONFIGURED BUT HARDCODED**

**Current:**
```javascript
// config.js - Falls back to production URL
return 'https://expense-tracker-hirq.onrender.com/api';
```

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Production URL hardcoded (good for release, but inflexible)
- ⚠️ No staging environment option
- ⚠️ No API version handling

**Recommendation:**
- Verify production backend is stable
- Add error handling for API timeouts
- Implement retry logic

### ❌ **12. App Store Listing (NOT STARTED)**
**Status: CONTENT NEEDED**

**Required for Play Store:**
- ❌ Short description (80 chars)
- ❌ Full description (4000 chars)
- ❌ Screenshots (minimum 2)
- ❌ Feature graphic
- ❌ Category selection
- ❌ Content rating questionnaire
- ❌ Target audience
- ❌ Contact details

### ⚠️ **13. Testing (MINIMAL)**
**Status: NO AUTOMATED TESTS**

**Missing:**
- ❌ Unit tests
- ❌ Integration tests
- ❌ E2E tests
- ❌ Manual test checklist

**Recommendation:**
- Create manual test script
- Test all user flows
- Test on multiple devices
- Test offline scenarios

### ⚠️ **14. Localization (PARTIAL)**
**Status: INFRASTRUCTURE PRESENT, LIMITED IMPLEMENTATION**

**Current:**
- [x] expo-localization installed
- [x] i18n setup in code
- [x] English and Hindi locale files exist

**Issues:**
- ⚠️ Only 2 languages supported
- ⚠️ Incomplete translations
- ⚠️ No RTL support for Arabic/Hebrew

## 🛠️ **Quick Fixes to Implement Now**

### 1. Remove Console Logs
```bash
# Find all console.logs
grep -r "console.log" src/

# Consider using a babel plugin to remove them in production
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-remove-console
```

### 2. Add to babel.config.js:
```javascript
module.exports = function(api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    plugins: [
      'react-native-reanimated/plugin'
    ],
    env: {
      production: {
        plugins: ['transform-remove-console']
      }
    }
  };
};
```

### 3. Update app.json with support URL:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "extra": {
      "supportUrl": "https://your-domain.com/support",
      "privacyPolicyUrl": "https://your-domain.com/privacy"
    }
  }
}
```
